//! Firmware-agnostic CCID applet clients (Yubico / ISO wire protocol).
//!
//! Each submodule speaks one applet's command set over a
//! [`CcidSession`](crate::hal::transport::ccid::CcidSession). The wire protocol
//! is identical across firmwares that emulate the Yubico applets, so only
//! *feature gating* differs — and that lives in
//! [`crate::hal::firmwares::applets`], keyed off the descriptors below.
//!
//! Adding a new applet screen means: a submodule here (the ops), a `*Features`
//! descriptor, a method on `AppletProfile`, and per-firmware answers — the UI
//! and transport layers do not change.
